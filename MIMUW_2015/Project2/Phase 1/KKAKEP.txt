1. Is there a model validation?

Yes, very detailed.
For 'Homogenity of variance for residuals' you may try an F test (variance in groups)


2. Have you tested an effect of an interaction?

You have presented results of F-test (and Wald test),
but you may consider also test based on permutations.


3. Have you explained the effect of interaction properly (in figure or in table)?

The fist table (section 'Results') is very good, but you shall consider adding p-values (are presented in the text below).
The interaction plot is also informative.

5/5 + 4/5 + 5/5  = 14
