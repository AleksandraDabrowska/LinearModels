1. Is there a model validation?

Yes, very good validation.
You have considered both logtrans and boxcox â€“ very good idea.


2. Have you tested an effect of an interaction?

You have presented results of F-test (and Wald test),
but you may consider also test based on permutations.


3. Have you explained the effect of interaction properly (in figure or in table)?

There is an interaction plot and there are averages.
But it will be a good idea to put these averages into a table to make it easier to compare.
