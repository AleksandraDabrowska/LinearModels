1. Is there a model validation?

Three plots, zero tests.
Moreover there are serious problems with distribution of residuals (visible with naked eye) but they were ignored.


2. Have you tested an effect of an interaction?

There is a test, but you tried only Wald test.
There is no p-value, not test statistic. Just information: TRUE/FALSE for significance level 0.05. It is much better to show p-value or test statistic rater just binary decision.


3. Have you explained the effect of interaction properly (in figure or in table)?

Boxplots and interaction diagrams are good and easy to read.
The model is correct.
But for boxplots you shall try some variable length transformation. The presented distribution is skewed and shall be corrected.
