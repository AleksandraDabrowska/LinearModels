1. Is there a model validation?

Yes, in the point 3.
There are plots, but no p-values.


2. Have you tested an effect of an interaction?

Yes,
but I would expect this test in the point 1 or 2. You have included it into the point 3 'How we got there?'.


3. Have you explained the effect of interaction properly (in figure or in table)?

The table and plots in sections 1 and 2 are proper.
But you shall plot them after variable transformation.

btw: the introduction should contain some overview. Here there is just R code, no explanations.
