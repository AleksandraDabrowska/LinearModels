I really like the section 'Results' in the beginning, with summary of obtained results.
It might be nice idea to enrich this section with a single plot or a drawing that summaries the final model 
(with group averages and standard deviation of averages or with map of considered models).

It is a good idea to include visual representation of correlation structure of fixed effect.
You may also consider more classical representations like

The dotplot plot is interesting, but I do not know why all densities are centered around 0.
Are they random effects without fixed component for treatment?

Plots for interactions are very interesting, but it will be easier to read them if all of them will have the same range of OY axis.

Also the use of model id's like model.1.1 is a good idea. It is much easier to refer to a particular model.


1. How do you model the effect of Animal?

As a random effect (with random interaction with treatment)


2. How do you model the effect of Photo (nested or crossed)?

Nested in study. 
It should be also nested in animal.
The boxplot for different photos are informative. But maybe they should be sorted along medial or mean? Both now the order on OY axis does not bring any information.
Very detailed study.

3. How do you model effects of mouse and treatment (not binary variables)?

Interactions are good. 
Transformation of length was a good idea.
Few things that you may additionally consider are: different contrasts, post hoc tests and possible grouping of mouse genotypes (there are ordered).
