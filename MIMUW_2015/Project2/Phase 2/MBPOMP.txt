I really like your plot for interactions (this with lines not with boxplots)
Adding +- 2x se and changing the order along OX axis may improve it even more.
It's a good summary for the most important effects.

Also the ecdf is a nice tool to compare distributions.


1. How do you model the effect of Animal?

As random effect, correct.

2. How do you model the effect of Photo (nested or crossed)?

Nested in animal - correct.	
You shall also consider the effect of study, but here you've add this information into Animal.


3. How do you model effects of mouse and treatment (not binary variables)?

As interaction - that's ok.
You could also consider post-hoc tests, grouping of similar levels or some specific contrasts (for mouse, here they are different in number of alleles)


Points
6/6 + 6/6 + 5/6 + 2 = 19
