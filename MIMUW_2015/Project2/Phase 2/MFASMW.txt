You focused a lot on model diagnostic,
But you ignored the presentation of the main effects.
Only basic summaries for main effects are presented (as boxplots), you can consider some more advanced plots like plots for interactions, predictions of random effects.


1. How do you model the effect of Animal?

As a random effect in the structure
Study/Animal/Photo_ID_abs
It's correct

2. How do you model the effect of Photo (nested or crossed)?

Nested in the random structure,
It's correct


3. How do you model effects of mouse and treatment (not binary variables)?

In the model you have considered an option with interaction and without.
This is correct.
But more variants should be taken into account.
Maybe you can remove ‘mouse + treatment’ from the random part?
Here in fact these are models as random interactions between mouse and animal/photo + treatment and animal/photo.

Also the results of interaction / additive effects can be presented with greater care. 
Consider interaction plots, table with group averages or other method to explain how mouse and treatment affect the length of spines.

6/6 + 6/6 + 2.5/6 + 2 = 16.5
