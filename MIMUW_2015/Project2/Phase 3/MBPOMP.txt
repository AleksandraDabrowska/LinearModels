First two plots are very important, but you have not included information if values on these plots take into account structure of random effects.
The second plot (interaction plot) will be superb if only there will be additionally confidence intervals calculated in model with random effects.
But without taking into account the random effects presented average are misleading.


1. Which treatments are selected as important?

Interactions of treatments and mice are considered. 
Five groups are identified.

2. How the effects of these treatments are presented?

Table, barplot with confidence intervals and interaction plot.
Plus post hoc tests included in the appendix.

But some of these plots present wrong values.

3. Do you choose right tests for the task?

The glht and permutation test. Good choice.
