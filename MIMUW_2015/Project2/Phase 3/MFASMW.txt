The slide 6 with dotplot + confidence interval will be very informative.

Where is the appendix with details?

1. Which treatments are selected as important?

Interactions of mice and treatment. 
No treatment/WT as base is good idea.

2. How the effects of these treatments are presented?

Table and ,,tree'' plot
In the table you could include confidence intervals for estimates.
In slide 13 you could add information how these groups were obtained (one sentence).

Main results are presented in a very informative manner. But there should be an appendix with technical details.

3. Do you choose right tests for the task?

Based on R code (Rpres) - yes. 
But such details / justifications should be in an appendix,


Points
8/8 + 6/8 + 7/8 + 1 = 22
