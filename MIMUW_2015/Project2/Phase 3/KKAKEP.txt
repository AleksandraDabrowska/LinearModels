The format is very good.
Plot with confidence intervals is very good.
Appendix is very good.

But I prefer the previous model with interactions. It was better than the one without interactions.


1. Which treatments are selected as important?

All except â€“ 
Some post hoc test would give more information if there are differences between gm/dsmo.
For mice effect WT should be selected as baseline (instead of KO)

2. How the effects of these treatments are presented?

Table and plot with effects.
The plot is very good.
But I would like to see it for all interactions treatment:mice

3. Do you choose right tests for the task?

Some R code is hidden, so it is hard to guess what the 'model.version1' stands for (of course it is possible from Rmd code).
Model diagnostic is good.
Structure of random effects is good.
Only lack of interactions is not good.
And here I do not see any test that justifies the lack of interactions.

7/8 + 6/8 + 6/8 + 1 = 20
