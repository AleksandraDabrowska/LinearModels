Overall experience

What I like most: you are trying to do more deep analysis of selected genes. This is a good direction, go deeper, find some gold.

What I do not like: It is not really a report, just a combination of output from R and some loose thoughts/comments.
I do not see any conclusions. The section 'to sum up' is hard to understand. 

Maybe you have did a lot of analyses but it looks like you have not bother to read results and comment them properly.


1. Is there a (small) list of genes?

There is small list of 6 genes. 
Selected genes are interesting due to some selected criteria. 
However: it is unlikely that 6 genes can explain differences between 12 cancers. Maybe it is true but I do not see any proof.

After reading all 35 pages I do not know which genes are different between which cancers.

Your comment 'CPNE5: -extract Gliobastoma Cancer', how to read it?
Extract from what?


2. Is there progress between phase 1 and phase 2?

The very positive thing in this report is the detailed and graphical diagnostic for selected genes.

But also this point may be significantly improved. Right now, attached plots for confidence intervals across all pairs is non informative.
They are messy, there is a lot of them, there is no short informative summary.

It looks like you have done it but then do not know what to do with results, therefore leave raw outputs without any comments.

It is a very bad solution. If you do not know how to interpret results, do not include them in the report.
If results cannot be read (due to resolution or orientation of text) then do not include them in the report.


3. Does it fit the 10 pages limit?

I've tried to print this html page in chrome and it showed 25 pages.



Others

Again, there is no table of contents. I do not see clear structure (it looks more as a history of R commands than real report) there is no real overview/summary of the report.


Points
5/6 + 4/6 + 2/6 + 2 = 13
