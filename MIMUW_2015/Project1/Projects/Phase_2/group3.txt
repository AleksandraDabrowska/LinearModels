Overall experience

I like the structure of the report.
The abstract is informative; you have presented the list of genes.

Two things that you should improve: 
There is no need to present all R commands and output from R code. R code is in Rmd file, no need to waste space for it in the report.
There is just one plot but I can barely read anything out of it. Present 4 panels instead of 6 and it will be easier to read anything. Also I think that the last interaction plots/boxplots might be interesting. Why you have commented them out?

1. Is there a (small) list of genes?

There is clearly stated list of 32 genes.
In phase 3 try to show how these genes behave for different cancers.


2. Is there progress between phase 1 and phase 2?

The structure is a lot better.
I have cut a single point because you may include more graphical summaries.

3. Does it fit the 10 pages limit?

Yes.
