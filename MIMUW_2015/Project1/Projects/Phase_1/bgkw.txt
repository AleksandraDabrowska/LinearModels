1. Model diagnostic. How was it done?

Only normality was checked with Shapiro Wilk test and alpha=0.05.
For almost all genes (16115) the test results in p-value lower than 0.05. 
There are no comments whatever it is good or not. After normality testing there are results.
So normality was tested but there are no conclusions from this phase.


2. List of genes. Is it included? Is it narrowed to some 'reasonable' number of genes?

List of genes is not attached, but it is mentioned that all genes has changed significantly.
Even then one would expect either a list of top 100 (or some similar number) or sub lists for genes that differ between BRCA vs others, LUNG vs others and so on.

3. Is there a structure in the report? Are there conclusions?

Literature and an introduction is a very good idea.

Few small changes would improve the structure a lot:
- add table of contents
- Something went wrong with first two headers (## requires an empty line after)
- some plots (boxplots) are very hard to read now


4. How many approaches have been tried out?

One and half (if counting the box-cox transformation as a second approach).

After having first set of results (here: all genes are significant) I would expect second more refined approach (e.g. what differs BRCA from others and so on).



Points
1.5/3 + 1.5/3 + 2.5/3 + 2/3 + 3 = 10.5
