1. What is your justification that these genes are important, are differential across different cancers (what statistical tests/procedures have been used)?

The example is good.
The approach is good.

But in boxplots you may consider some presentation of the range of values for a given cancer. Right now you have only mean + intervals but it is hard to see if these groups are well separated (averages are).


2. How do you present gene profiles for different cancers (is it easy to understood what expression is characteristic for each cancer)?

Boxplots are very good, but I do not like your use of colours. Instead of having different colours for each cancer you may consider using different colours for different clusters.

Also it is not clear why the right plot is always wider than the left plot.

Maybe it will be easier to read cancer names if they are on OX axis not on the legend.

Also I think that it will be better to compare caners for a single gene (how cancers are different)
rather than comparing genes for same cancer (genes may be different but we are going to separate cancers not genes)


3. Is the presentation and description understandable for non-statistician (we will have a molecular biologist to comment your presentations). You should be correct but not lost in details.

The example is god.
The lack of paragraphs and lack formatting is not.
But I like the ppt presentation as an supplement for the report. In my opinion the presentation is too long.
