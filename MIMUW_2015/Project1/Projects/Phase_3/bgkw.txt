1. What is your justification that these genes are important, are differential across different cancers (what statistical tests/procedures have been used)?

You have used anova to identify genes that have significantly different averages across groups.
But I do not agree that these genes 'differentiate all cancer types in this study'.

Even the plot for '?|390284' shows that maybe Glioblastoma has different average expression than Leukemia, but it is not like you can differentiate these two cancers based on this single gene. 


2. How do you present gene profiles for different cancers (is it easy to understood what expression is characteristic for each cancer)?

The use of boxplot is a very good idea.
But in some cases I do not understand the colouring. 
For example for "?|90288" you have highlighted Glioblastoma, but it is in the middle among other cancers. So is it like it is different from all others?

Similar problem with "?|653553".

3. Is the presentation and description understandable for non-statistician (we will have a molecular biologist to comment your presentations). You should be correct but not lost in details.

These boxplots are very informative.
But I do not agree that three genes are enough (differences in averages is not enough to have good separation of distributions),

The table with characteristic genes for each cancer is a very good idea.
But some graphical summary of the whole table would be even better.
