1. What is your justification that these genes are important, are differential across different cancers (what statistical tests/procedures have been used)?

Proper approach. Also the plots for different cancers are very informative.
The only thing that you may consider is using ecdf instead of histograms. 
Ecdf is much better when it comes to distributions. 
Even for histograms it would be better to normalized these histograms (now counts are presented instead of proportions)


2. How do you present gene profiles for different cancers (is it easy to understood what expression is characteristic for each cancer)?

Table is a good presentation.
You may consider for example boxplots to compare distributions for selected 10 genes for each cancer.
It will use similar amount of space but may bring more information 
(whole distribution instead of cutoff, distributions will show you how good is the separation)


3. Is the presentation and description understandable for non-statistician (we will have a molecular biologist to comment your presentations). You should be correct but not lost in details.

It is very good.
The report is concise and concrete.
However you may consider adding a point 'Summary of the results from this phase'.
