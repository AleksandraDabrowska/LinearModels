First, complete the `02_lab.Rmd` lab. Then:

1. Present diagnostic plots for obtained one-way ANOVA model.
2. Try Box-Cox transformation to verify if any transformation improves the model fit
3. Try all discussed model diagnostic tests to verify is all model assumptions are fulfilled.
4. If any test has not passed, try to transform original variables to overcome the problem with assumptions.
