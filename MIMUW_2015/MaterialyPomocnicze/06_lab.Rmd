# Intro

In the `schizophrenia` dataset you will find genotypes and phenotypes for 98 patients with schizophrenia disorder.

Dikeos scores for 5 domains are used to assess the mental health (see `http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/189/4/346`). Let's see if there is relation between genetic factors (NfkB, CD28, IFN) and these domains.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(PBImisc)
head(schizophrenia)
```

# What to do

1. Work in small groups (2-3 people).

2. For each trait (manic, depression, reality distortion, ...) find if there is a link between the train and genetic variables. Try one-dimensional model and multi-dimensional models. Check for interactions.

3. Take into account number of tests that you have performed. Should you use FDR or FWER correction?

4. Decide (in the group) what are your final conclusions.

5. Talk with the teacher about your results.
