Modify the shiny app, that was presented during lectures in following directions:

1. Add possibility of specifying sizes of each group. How the power of the test depends on the lack of balance in groups?

2. Add possibility of specifying contrasts for factors. How the power of the aov/lm test depends on contrast that is used?

3. Add the possibility of choosing range for the total number of observation. How the power of the test depends on the sample size?
