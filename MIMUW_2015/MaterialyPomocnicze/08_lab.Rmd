# Intro

Let's use the `prostate` dataset to identify which variables are linked with PSA (prostate specific antigen), known diagnostic marker.

In this dataset the `lpsa` describes logarithm of PSA.

```{r}
library(faraway)
head(prostate)
```

# What to do

1. Work in small groups (2-3 people).

2. The goal of this exercise is to identify the relation between `lpsa` and other variables from `prostate` dataset.

3. Consider following strategies:  a stepwise model selection, the LASSO model selection. If VIF are large then consider ridge regression. If some observations are influential consider robust regression.

4. Decide (in the group) what is the 'best' model.

5. Compare models across groups.
